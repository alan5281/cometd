      # Test Suite Update  (2-28 meeting mst )
      
   * Possible agenda items
      # Globbing  -  Channels are currently based on URI format without parameters.  
         {{{
channel_name  = "/"  path_segments
path_segments = segment *( "/" segment )
segment       = *pchar
pchar         = alphanum | mark
         }}}
      Globbing was left out of spec but there is renewed interest.  Listed below are some general goals for globbing
          * No matching of partial topic names {{{/foo*}}} does not match {{{/foobar}}}
          * Need at least "this or below" matching   {{{/foo/*}}} would match /foo/bar and {{{/foo/bar/asdf}}} and possibly "this and just one level below" matching
          * More complex syntax equals more complex matching,  {{{/foo/*/bar}}} will be more difficult....
     _Possible Solutions_
          * No wildcards....
          * Do not allow wildcards and use extension mechansim to indicate wildcards as advanced feature.  Server implementors could then specify type of wildcards the server supports (simple wildcards,   wildcards based on WS-Topics spec, etc).  Possibly allow wildcards in future version of Bayeux spec.
          * Implement wildcard system based on above goals and include in specfication.  Possibly allow more advanced wildcard systems in extension/advanced feature mechanism.
          * Investigate and use more advanced wildcarding - JMS globbing (pick a vendor specific one), WS-topics, etc.  Or come up with own specification.
